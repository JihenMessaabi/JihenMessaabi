I am **Jihen Messaabi,** full-stack engineer, and I specialize in efficient Angular apps with Spring boot based server side that offers an excellent user experience while ensuring the smooth operations.

- My professional life has been 100% driven by my passion for design and development.  For more than two years now, I've worked for multiple e-commerce platforms in Italy.
After that, I was in charge of implementing and launching several apps for large Italian retail & inventory industry, within a great team!
- Not that learning Angular & Spring at the same time made things easy for me. Still, in the end, I was able to deliver apps that's used by hundreds of distributors and direct customers daily and did so on-time and on-budget.

- Engineering skilled in Agile Methodologies, Software Design, Development and deployment work for large and fast-growing supermarket chain in Italy.
